 * \brief This file contains an exhaustive list of the supported architectures
 * The declaration of a new architecture must be done as follows:
 * \code
 * #ifdef _ARCHDEF_<architecture name>
 * ARCH_ASMBL(<architecture name>)
 * #endif
 * \endcode
 * where:
 * - \<architecture name\> is the internal name of the architecture. For coherence, it is advised that this
 * name be the same as the one in the ISA description file and the name of the directory containing the files
 * specific to the architecture. It should also be the same name as the one used for option in the configure script
