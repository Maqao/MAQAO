*** Note from MAQAO developpers about the libdwarf integration into MAQAO ***
* Current libdwarf version: 20170416

To update lidwarf sources, get the last version at http://www.prevanders.net/dwarf.html
Get the content of the subdirectory libdwarf and copy it into MAQAO/src/madras/libdbg/libdwarf/.
The following files can be excluded from the copy:
 - ChangeLog*
 - CHANGES
 - checkexamples.c
 - CODINGSTYLE
 - dwlinetablheader.txt
 - *.mm
 - *.pdf
 - Makefile.in
 - NEWS
 - README
 
Some files must be moved into MAQAO/src/madras/libdbg/libdwarf/generators. These files are the one used
to create gennames target. Currently there are two files:
 - gennames.c
 - dwgetopt.c
This is needed to cross compile MAQAO (for Xeon Phi architecture for example).

Now update the following copied files (the following list may be changed with further libdwarf evolutions):
* libdwarf.h.in
  - Comment the line: typedef struct Elf Elf;

* config.h.in.cmake
  - Add symbol wrappers for Windows _snprintf and _vsnprintf
   
* configure.cmake
  - Add overrides to the following values before the configure_file on config.h.in.cmake:
    Override to 1:
    - HAVE_ELF_H
    - HAVE_LIBELF_H
    - HAVE_ELF64_RELA
    - HAVE_ELF64_SYM
    - HAVE_ELF64_GETEHDR
    - HAVE_ELF64_GETSHDR
    - HAVE_RAW_LIBELF_OK
    - HAVE_LIBELF_OFF64_OK
    Override to 0:
    - HAVE_ZLIB
  
* CMakeLists.txt
  - Add the following content from the CMakeLists.txt at the root of the libdwarf package:
    + Includes
    + Headers checking
    + Replace detection of libelf with setting of LIBELF_INCLUDE_DIRS to INCLUDE_OUTPUT_PATH and LIBELF_LIBRARIES to libelf.so
  - Define the DWARF_TARGETS, DWARF_TYPES and DWARF_COMPILE_FLAGS as list containing respectively {dwarf-obj-static, dwarf-obj-dyn},
    {OBJECT, OBJECT} and {$C_STATIC_FLAGS, $C_DYNAMIC_FLAGS}
  - Add the generator subdirectory
  - Comment or remove all commands related to the gennames target
  - Add the use of the DWARF_COMPILE_FLAGS when compiling the targets from the list
  - Move the dependencies of the library targets to the CONFIGURE_FILES to a separate custom target to keep compatibility with cmake 2.8 
  - Comment the commands related to naming and installing the targets
  - Comment the commands related to libz
  - Comment all commands related to generating the pdf files
  - Add target do_dwarf depending on dwarf-obj-static and dwarf-obj-dyn
  - Add commands to copy the dwarf.h and libdwarf.h headers to the include dir
  - Add target distclean_libdwarf to remove the files generated in the libdwarf directory by the compilation (gennames and the libraries)
