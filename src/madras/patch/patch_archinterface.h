/**
 * \page patcher_driver Interface with architecture specific code
 * \brief Description of the architecture specific functions to define
 *
 * The patcher handles multiple architectures through the use of a driver defining a set of architecture specific functions that will be loaded
 * from the relevant architecture (retrieved from the patched file). Those functions must be defined for each architecture implemented by the patcher
 *
 * \section driver_functions Description of the functions
 * Each function must be prefixed with the architecture name. They will be loaded into a driver identifying them with their suffixes.
 *
 * \subsection generate_insnlist_functioncall Generation of a function call
 * This function generates the instruction list for invoking a function. The generated instructions must include the following operations:
 * - Compare and branch instructions for the serialised conditions
 * - Parameters passing
 * - Saving the context (if necessary)
 * - Moving or shifting the stack (if necessary)
 * - Aligning the stack
 * - Retrieving return value
 *
 * The function also returns pointer to the actual branch instruction performing the function call.
 * It will also return pointer to all instructions referencing a memory address, to allow linking them with the \e libmtroll structures.
 *
 * \subsection generate_insnlist_jmpaddr Generation of an unconditional branch
 * This function must generate an instruction list for performing an unconditional branch to an instruction.
 *
 * \subsection generate_insnlist_smalljmpaddr Generation of a small unconditional branch
 * This function must generate an instruction list for performing an unconditional branch to an instruction, using the short version of the instruction if
 * it exists for the given architecture, otherwise return NULL if this architecture does not defines branch instructions of different sizes.
 * The function must also return the range accessed by this instruction.
 *
 * \subsection generate_insn_nop Generation of a nop instruction
 * This function must generate a \c nop instruction of a given size. If the architecture does not define \c nop instructions of the given size, the
 * variant with the closest size will be returned. Requesting a size 0 returns the smallest possible \c nop instruction.
 *
 * \subsection upd_dataref_coding Update of an instruction referencing memory
 * This function must update the binary coding of an instruction referencing a memory address based on the instruction's address.
 * It will be used chiefly by the \c libmtroll when updating targets of RIP-based memory instructions.
 *
 * \subsection generate_insnlist_pltcall Generation of a PLT stub
 * This function must generate the instruction list used in ELF files for invoking a dynamic function. It must return pointers to the instructions in
 * the list referencing the global offset table and the beginning of the stub used for invoking the dynamic loader.
 *
 * \subsection others Other functions
 * Other functions must also perform the following operations:
 * - Testing if a given instruction is a \c nop
 * - Returning an operand used to reference a memory address based from the instruction's address
 * - Returning branch instruction performing the logical opposite of a conditional branch
 * - Returning the instructions used to perform a return from an invoked function
 * - Adding the instructions representing conditions to an instruction list
