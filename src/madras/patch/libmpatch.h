/**
 * \file libmpatch.h
 * \brief Libmpatch is a library allowing to patch binary files from multiple architectures.
 *
 *	\page patch_main Patcher documentation page
 *	\todo This page will need some rewriting after the refactoring of the patcher. 
 * For this reason, it focuses mainly on the general principles, and skips over the 
 * implementation details.
 *	\e Libmpatch is a library allowing to patch binary files from multiple architectures.
 *
 *	The current implementation supports the x86_64 architecture and the ELF file format.
 *
 *	\section patch_general General description
 *	The functions from \e libmpatch allow to patch executable files. The following operations are supported:
 *	- Insertion of function calls (function \ref patchfile_patch_insertfct)
 *	- Insertion of assembly code (function \ref patchfile_insertcode)
 *	- Replacing a group of instructions by another (function \ref patchfile_patch_replaceinsn)
 *	- Deletion of code (function \ref patchfile_patch_removecode)
 *	- Insertion of global variables (function \ref patchfile_patch_insertdata)
 *
 * All patching sessions must be finalised with a call to \ref patchfile_patch. This function is responsible for building the patched file.
 *
 * All data used by the patcher is stored into a \ref patchfile_t structure for the duration of the patching session.
 *
 * \section patch_principles General principles
 *
 * \subsection patch_challenge Main challenge
 *
 * All modifications that would change the size of the code (insertion or deletion of code, 
 * modification into an instruction coded on less bytes) are not possible to do directly, as 
 * this would shift all	addresses, including the ones pointing to the data segment (which are 
 * not directly identifiable).
 *
 * \subsection patch_move Code displacement
 *
 * The method used to avoid the problem described in \ref patch_challenge is code displacement: 
 * the code that must be modified is moved to another, new section of the file, whose virtual 
 * address will be out of the original range of virtual addresses of the file (this is taken 
 * care of by \e libmtroll). A branch is inserted, replacing the original code, and points 
 * to the moved code. Another branch is added at the end of the displaced code, pointing to 
 * the next instruction after the original code. The displaced code can then be modified 
 * without any impact on the remaining of the code.
 *
 * This method presents however a shortcoming in the case of architectures with instructions of 
 * different sizes (like x86). In this case, there is no assurance that the inserted branch will 
 * not be larger than the code to be moved. In such a case, it is necessary to also move the surrounding
 * instructions, but at the risk of also moving the target of another branch instruction, which 
 * would find itself pointing to the middle of the inserted jump instruction.
 *
 * The chosen solution is then to move the whole basic block containing the address where the code 
 * modification must take place. The block is replaced by a branch instruction, followed by 
 * \c nop instructions padding the length of the original block. The basic block is moved and 
 * modified according to the patching requests. A return branch is added at the end.
 *
 * Another advantage of this method is that it reduces the number of added branches if more than
 * one modification has to happen in the same basic block, as it will be moved only once.
 *
 * \subsubsection patch_displ_pbs Pitfalls and solutions
 *
 * The method of displacing basic blocks presents two other problems:
 * - Correct detection of basic blocks: it is possible that an instruction in the middle of a basic 
 *   block is actually the target of an indirect branch instruction. There is currently no way to 
 *   detect this, and it can lead to crashes when the patched file is run.
 * - Size of the basic block: it is again possible that the basic block is shorter than the branch 
 *   instructions, leading to the same problem as when attempting to move a single instruction.
 *
 * In the case of a basic block smaller than the branch instruction, a workaround is implemented if 
 * the architecture offers a smaller branch instruction, allowing for a smaller offset (this is the 
 * case in x86_64, where there are instructions allowing to branch to instructions distant of up to 128 bytes).
 *
 * If the smaller branch instruction can fit in the basic block to move, it is then used to displace the code 
 * using a trampoline. In this method, a nearby block, close enough to be reached with a small branch 
 * instruction from the original block and large enough to contain two larger branch instructions, is moved 
 * using the standard method for code displacement. In the space left, a large branch instruction is inserted
 * (designated as a trampoline branch), pointing to the displaced smaller block that needed to be moved in the 
 * first place. The smaller block is replaced by a smaller branch instruction pointing to this trampoline 
 * branch. The displaced smaller block is appended with a large branch instruction pointing to the end of the 
 * original smaller block, as is the normal behaviour.
 *
 * There is still a case where a basic block is smaller than the smallest branch instruction available. In 
 * this case, a workaround consists in moving the whole function containing the block to move. This method 
 * is not used by default and must be requested by the user, as the main policy of \e libmpatch is to avoid 
 * moving too much code to reduce the risk of moving the target of an undetected indirect branch. Some OpenMP 
 * codes have also been observed to contain indirect branches into the body of a function.
 *
 * In the current version, the default behaviour if an displacement can not be done is to skip it and print an 
 * error message. A flag allows to bypass this behaviour and force the displacement anyway. This can be useful 
 * when all the blocks adjacent to the one causing the error will also be displaced, thus solving the lack of 
 * space problem. Usually however, forcing the displacement may lead the patched file to crash.
 *
 * \section patching Patching operations
 * \todo The implementation of patching operation will change with the patcher refactoring. Because of this, 
 * some fine-grained implementation details are skipped.
 *
 * \subsection inscode Inserting assembly code
 *
 * When inserting code, the block containing the insertion site will be displaced as explained in
 * \ref patch_move. The inserted instructions are inserted into the displaced block at the appropriate address.
 *
 * If the code has to be inserted before the given address, an extra step will be the update of all branch instruction
 * to this address to point at the inserted branch pointing to the displaced code. This ensures that the inserted
 * code will be always executed before the original instruction.
 *
 * \subsection insfunc Inserting function call
 *
 * The patcher allows to insert a call to a function. In the current version, only calls to functions already 
 * present in the binary or to functions defined in a dynamic library can be inserted.
 *
 * When inserting a function call, the block containing the insertion site will be displaced as explained in 
 * \ref patch_move. The assembly instructions for the function call will be inserted into the displaced block 
 * at the appropriate address, surrounded by the instructions needed to save and restore the context if requested.
 *
 * The assembly instructions are retrieved from architecture-specific functions.
 *
 * If the function is defined in an external library, a new block of code containing the architecture-specific
 * instructions for a stub for invoking an external function is added, with the appropriate instructions. 
 * The inserted call will point to this stub.
 *
 * An function call insertion is handled as an insertion of assembly code, with the instructions for invoking the
 * function and saving or restoring the context considered as the instructions to insert.
 *
 * \subsection replacecode Replacing a group of instructions
 *
 * Replacing a group of instructions can serve two purposes:
 * - Modifying an instruction. In effect, this amounts to remove it and replace it by another instruction with 
 *   the modified characteristics.
 * - Replacing a group of instructions by \c nop instructions.
 *
 * If the replacement causes the code to change size, which happens when we are modifying an instruction 
 * to replace it with an instruction coded on a different length, the block containing the modification to 
 * performed will be moved as described in \ref patch_move. Otherwise, the modification will directly take 
 * place in the original code.
 *
 * \subsection delcode Deletion of code
 *
 * When deleting code, the block containing the deletion site will be displaced as explained in \ref patch_move. 
 * The instructions are then deleted from the displaced block at the appropriate address.
 *
 * \subsection insdata Insertion of global variables
 * Global variables are stored during the patching session in the \c data member of the \ref patchfile_t structure.
 * The content of each variable is copied here, and the \ref globvar_t structure representing the global variable
 * is updated to store the offset in the \c data memory area where the content of this variable was copied.
 *
 * Global variables used in inserted instruction lists (either assembly code or function insertion) are referenced
 * by adding a new ELF target using the \e libmtroll function \ref elffile_add_targetscnoffset. The references will
 * ensure the code of the instructions using theses variables as RIP-based operands are updated when building the
 * patched file.
 *
 * \subsection conditions Handling conditions
 * In the current version, conditions can be set on an insertion modification only (instruction list or function).
 * The conditions will be serialised before the actual insertion takes place, arranging them in a format convertible
 * into assembly instructions.
 *
 * A condition for an insertion is represented as a binary tree, whose leaves are the conditions on numerical value and an operand,
 * and the other nodes are logical comparisons between conditions.
 * The serialisation aims at ordering the leaves conditions so that they can be expressed as a sequence of comparison and conditional branches
 * Therefore the goal is to identify for each condition the test to be performed and the destination of the conditional branch, which can
 * be either another condition, the beginning of the insertion (means the whole condition on the insertion was evaluated as true),
 * or its end (means the whole condition on the insertion was evaluated as false).
 *
 * \todo We may not need this here, but maybe as the comments on \ref cond_serialize. Or, rewrite this algorithm as it should be, not as it is (badly)
 * implemented in \ref cond_serialize
 *
 * The serialisation algorithm is the following:
 * -# Numbering of the leaves from left to right using a depth-first search. This ensures conditions will be evaluated as in C
 * -# Looping over the leaves in the order into which they were numbered:
 *    - If the condition is the last leaf: the comparison will be made on the logical opposite of the condition's and branch to the end of the insertion
 *      (the last comparison will be followed by the inserted code, which will not be executed if the reverse of the condition is true)
 *    - If the condition is the first child of its parent
 *      - If the parent is an \c AND comparison
 *        -# Searches the tree upward for the first parent node that is an \c OR comparison and from which the condition is a descendant of its
 *           first child
 *           - If no such node is found, the comparison will be made on the logical opposite of the condition's and branch to the end of the insertion
 *             (this is the first condition of a series of \c AND statements, if it fails the inserted code will not be executed)
 *           - If such a parent node is found, the comparison will be made on the logical opposite of the condition's and branch to the leaf that
 *             is a descendant of all first children of the second child of the parent node
 *             (this is the first condition of a chain that contains at least an \c OR statement, if it fails we will have to test the first condition
 *             in the other argument of the \c OR)
 *      - Else if the parent is an \c OR comparison
 *        -# Searches the tree upward for the first parent node that is an \c AND comparison and from which the condition is a descendant of its
 *           first child
 *           - If no such node is found, the comparison will be the same as the one in the condition, and branch to the beginning of the insertion
 *              (this is the first condition in a series of \c OR statements, if it succeeds the inserted code will be executed)
 *           - If such a parent node is found, the comparison will be the same as the one in the condition and branch to the leaf that
 *             is a descendant of all first children of the second child of the parent node
 *             (this is the first condition of a chain that contains at least an \c AND statement, if it succeeds we will have to test the first condition
 *             in the other argument of the \c AND)
 *    - Else if the condition is the second child of its parent
 *      -# Searches the tree upward for the first condition that is an \c OR comparison and from which the condition is a descendant of its first child
 *         - If no such node is found and the root of the tree is an \c AND comparison, the test will be performed on the logical opposite of the condition's
 *           and branch to the end of the insertion (this is the second condition in a series of \c AND statements, if it fails the inserted code will not
 *           be executed)
 *         - If no such node is found and the root of the tree is an \c OR comparison, the test will be the same as the one in the condition and branch
 *           to the beginning of the insertion (this is the second condition in a series of \c OR statements, if it succeeds the inserted code will be executed)
 *         - If such a condition is found
 *           -# Searches the tree for the first parent node that is an \c AND comparison and from which the condition is a descendant of its second child
 *              - If no such node is found, the comparison will be the same as the one in the condition, and branch to the beginning of the insertion
 *              (this is the first condition in a series of \c OR statements, if it succeeds the inserted code will be executed)
 *              - If such a node is found, the comparison will be the same as the one in the condition, and branch to the leaf that
 *             is a descendant of all first children of the second child of the parent node (this is the first condition of a chain that contains at least an \c AND statement, if it succeeds we will have to test the first condition
 *             in the other argument of the \c AND)
 *
 * \section commit Committing modifications
 *
 * Committing modifications launches the actual patching of the file from the list of pending modifications. This is done in \ref patchfile_patch.
 *
 * The operation will first apply all pending modifications, then finalise the patching session and generate the patched file.
 *
 * \subsection apply Applying modifications
 *
 * Pending modifications are applied in the following order:
 * - Dynamic libraries renaming through invocation of \ref elffile_rename_dynamic_library
 * - Insertion of dynamic libraries through invocation of \ref elffile_add_dynlib
 * - Reservation of the space for global variables in the \c data member of the \ref patchfile_t structure used for representing the patch operation
 * and updating the offset of the variables in \c data
 * - Loops over the list of modification requests to apply them. This is actually done in two steps, first \e processing the modifications, then \e applying.
 * Only modifications that were successfully processed are applied. In the current version, only the insertions (code or function call) are processed,
 * other modifications being simply flagged as successfully processed.
 *  - The following actions are performed when processing a modification:
 *    - Conditions (if existing) are serialised
 *    - Associated \c else modifications are processed and linked to the insertion
 *    - If the insertion corresponds to a external function call, its entry point is inserted:
 *      - If it is a dynamic function, a new stub is added to the list of instructions representing the new .plt section (element \c plt_list of the
 *        \ref patchfile_t structure)
 *    - Links the insertion to other modifications (fixed or floating) if needed
 *  - The actions described in \ref inscode, \ref replacecode and \ref delcode are performed when applying a modification
 * - The patching session is finalised (see \ref finalpatch) invoking \ref patchfile_patch_finalize
 * - The label modifications requests are then applied
 *
 * \subsection finalpatch Finalising patching session
 * The following actions are performed when finalising a patching session:
 * - The symbols in added object files (static patching) are resolved, building a list of the necessary object files to add to the file
 * from the list of static libraries to insert
 * - Branch rebounds are removed by replacing unconditional direct branches (not a \c call) branching to another unconditional branch by
 * an unconditional branch to the destination of the second branch. Branches in the inserted code section pointing to the instruction
 * immediately following them are deleted.
 * - The size of the added code section is calculated. A safety length, equal to the difference between the length of a short and a long jump
 * times the number of branches in the inserted code, is added to this size.
 * - The binary coding of the inserted code section is updated
 * - The size of the added plt section is calculated.
 * - The \e libmtroll function \ref elfexe_scnreorder is invoked to assign section identifiers to the new sections:
 *   - Data, if global variables are inserted or if the stack is moved to a location in the file
 *   - PLT, if calls to dynamic functions are added
 *   - Code, if code modifications were performed
 * - The addresses of inserted object files (static patching) are updated
 * - All references to inserted data are updated by invoking the \e libmtroll function \ref elffile_add_targetscnoffset
 * - The allocated size of the data section is increased with the size of the moved stack if necessary
 * - The binary code and addresses of the new PLT sections are updated
 * - The addresses and coding in the inserted code section are updated. This is done through a loop until both are stable, as the different sizes of branch
 * instructions means that the size of an instruction may increase when updating its code, thus spreading another branch instruction further from its destination
 * and necessitating it to change coding as well, also increasing its size.
 * - The address references in the ELF file are updated using the \e libmtroll function elffile_updtargets
 * - The binary binary data contained in the sections holding code and the PLT are updated
 * - The \e libmtroll function \ref copy_elf_file_reorder is invoked to generate the patched file.
