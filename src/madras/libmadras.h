/**
 * \page madras_api Libmadras documentation page
 * \brief Description of the MADRAS API
 *
 * \e Libmadras is an API allowing to access the functionalities of the MADRAS (Multi Architecture Disassembler Rewriter and ASsembler) disassembler
 * (\e libmdisass) and patcher (\e libmpatch).
 *
 * The \e libmadras API allows to disassemble a binary file, examine its contents, and patch it. Patching operations cover inserting function
 * calls or assembly instruction, delete or modify existing assembly instructions, and modify the list of libraries needed by a file.
 *
 * Since \e libmadras relies on \e libmdisass and \e libmpatch, it is available on architectures those libraries have been compiled to support.
 * In the current version, only the x86-64 architecture and the ELF binary format are supported.
 *
 * \section madrasdoc_structs Libmadras structures
 *
 * The main structure used by \e libmadras is \ref elfdis_t. It is used to store a disassembled file (as a \ref asmfile_t structure),
 * the modification requests and logging settings. An \ref elfdis_t structure is returned upon disassembling a new file. It must be freed
 * using \ref madras_terminate.
 *
 * All subsequent \e libmadras functions need a pointer to the current \ref elfdis_t structure. It is unadvised to access directly the members
 * of an \ref elfdis_t structure.
 *
 * \section madrasdoc_diss Disassembling functions
 *
 * The main function for disassembly is \ref madras_disass_file. It needs a valid filename and will return a pointer to a new \ref elfdis_t
 * structure containing the disassembled file. None of the structural analysis functions from \e libmcore are performed on the disassembled
 * file. Only the information from the disassembly are available.
 *
 * \section madrasdoc_info Retrieving informations about a disassembled file
 *
 * The API allows to define a cursor on instructions present in the disassembled file. It is possible to move the cursor along the list of instructions and to retrieve
 * informations on the instruction the cursor currently points to.
 *
 * This part of the API is subject to change in the following releases of MADRAS.
 *
 * \todo Update this section when the status of the API is clarified.
 *
 * \section madrasdoc_patch Patching functions
 *
 * The functions allow to patch a file and save the results to a binary file. A patching session contains the following steps:
 * -# Patcher initialisation: this operation sets the variables needed for the patching operation
 * -# Patch requests: a series of patching requests. No patching is actually performed at this stage.
 * -# Patch commit: this step must always be the last one. It performs all the patch requests and writes the result to another file.
 *
 * In the current version, only one patching session can be performed on a disassembled file. It is also not possible to produce multiple patched
 * files from a single disassembled file. It is advised to terminate the \ref elfdis_t structure after a patching session has been completed. If
 * other patching operations are needed, a new structure must be created by disassembling the file once again.
 *
 * Because patching operations are all performed during the commit, potential patching errors will all be reported at that time.
 *
 * \subsection madrasdoc_patch_init Patcher initialisation
 *
 * Patcher initialisation must occur before applying any patch requests. It is performed through the function \ref madras_modifs_init.
 *
 * This function also allows to choose the method used for saving the stack when performing code insertions. This is important, since an inserted
 * code can use the stack for saving the context before performing a function call, and such an inserted function can itself be using the stack.
 * As insertions can be performed anywhere in the code, there is no guarantee that the necessary steps for preserving the stack before a call have
 * been done (unlike what happens on a compiled code), so the content of the stack can be corrupted by the insertions. This can lead to errors in the
 * patched file if the stack contained values used by the original code and that have been changed by the inserted code. The patched executable may even
 * crash if pointers were present on the stack.
 *
 * \e Libmadras offers three different ways of dealing with the stack:
 * - \b Keep: The stack pointer is not modified in any way. This mode is advised for insertions into codes where the stack is not used, or for patching
 * sessions which will not involve code insertions. It can lead to crashes if used for insertion into codes where the stack is used.
 * - \b Move: The stack is moved to an area of memory that has been added to the file. This ensures that the stack used by the inserted code does not
 * overlap with existing memory areas. However, it is not supported in multi-threaded mode, as the same area will be used for all threads. It can also
 * lead to an overflow if the inserted functions make a heavy use of the stack, as the size reserved for the moved stack is limited (currently to 1 Mb).
 * - \b Shift: The stack is shift upward by a number of bytes defined by the user. This allows to skip the area used by the current stack while
 * remaining thread-safe. As there is currently no way to know the top size of the current stack, this method may still lead to errors in the
 * patched file if the shift is not important enough. It has been observed that a shift of 512 bytes is enough for all tested codes. This mode
 * is advised for most patching sessions involving function call insertions.
 *
 * \subsection madras_datamodifs Data modification
 *
 * The MADRAS patcher allows to insert a new global variable to the file, using the \ref madras_globalvar_new function. The inserted global variable can be
 * accessed from any place of the executable; as its address is fixed, it is not protected against multi-thread access.
 *
 * An inserted global variable will be filled with zeroes by default. It is possible to specify a value to initialise it. This is the standard behaviour when
 * inserting strings.
 *
 * It is possible to use either the address or the value of global variables as parameters to inserted functions (see \ref madrasdoc_insfctcall) or
 * operands to inserted instructions (see \ref madrasdoc_insasminsns).
 *
 * \subsection madras_libsmodifs Libraries modification
 *
 * It is possible to modify the list of dynamic libraries needed by an executable. The name of a needed library can be changed using the \ref madras_extlib_rename function.
 * This can be useful for instance when a needed dynamic library has been itself patched and saved under a different name.
 *
 * The dynamic library where is defined a function whose call is inserted (see \ref madrasdoc_insfctcall) is automatically added to the list of needed libraries.
 * The function \ref madras_extlib_add also allows to do that but it is currently redundant. In future implementations, it will allows to insert static libraries to a file.
 *
 * \subsection madras_codemodifs Code modification
 *
 * The MADRAS patcher allows to insert calls to functions present in a file or defined in a dynamic library, insert assembly code, and delete or modify
 * instructions.
 *
 * All modifications are performed in the order of ascending addresses. In case of multiple modifications at the same address, the modifications will
 * be performed in the order into which their respective requests were made. It is also possible to choose whether an insertion must be performed
 * before or after the instruction present at the given address.
 *
 * The behaviour of the MADRAS patcher is undefined if an instruction is requested to be deleted as well as modified. It is also not possible to modify
 * an instruction that is being added by the patcher.
 *
 * All functions allowing to modify the code return a pointer to a \ref modif_t structure. This pointer represents the modification request and allows
 * to add further options to it.
 *
 * All modifications performing code insertions can be set at a null address. Those modifications are intended to be used either when linked to another
 * insertion (see \ref madrasdoc_linkmodifs) or as an "else" statement to an insertion with conditions (see \ref madrasdoc_conds). An error will be raised
 * when committing modifications requests if some unlinked modifications are set at a null address.
 *
 *
 * \subsubsection madrasdoc_insfctcall Inserting a function call
 *
 * It is possible to insert a call to a function either defined in an dynamic library file or already present in the executable, using the
 * \ref madras_fctcall_new function. If no library name is provided, the MADRAS patcher will assume the function is present in the executable, and will
 * display an error if not found. The current implementation does not support the insertion of functions defined in a static library, and does not
 * support the insertion of functions in a statically compiled executable.
 *
 * When inserting a function call, the MADRAS patcher will automatically surround the inserted call with the appropriate assembly instructions for saving
 * and restoring all registers, as well as aligning the stack pointer and saving the current stack depending on the chosen method (as described in
 * \ref madrasdoc_patch_init). The \ref madras_fctcall_new_nowrap function allows to insert only the function call without any such surrounding
 * instructions. This function can be useful to reduce the overhead of saving and restoring the context provided the user takes care of it (using
 * for instance \ref madras_insnlist_add to save and restore only a subset of registers) or if the inserted function can not change the execution
 * context or on the contrary if it is the expected behaviour.
 * \note \ref madras_fctcall_new_nowrap is now deprecated, as the same result can be obtained using \ref madras_fctcall_new then \ref madras_modif_addopt
 * with the \ref PATCHOPT_FCTCALL_NOWRAP flag.
 *
 * Both functions return a pointer to a \ref modif_t structure, which contains all the details on an insertion request. The pointer can be used
 * to add parameters and return value to the function call by invoking the \c madras_fctcall_add* functions.
 *
 * An inserted function call can accept up to 6 parameters (additional parameters will be ignored). Parameters can either be a valid assembly
 * operand passed in string form (using \ref madras_fctcall_addparam_fromstr), an operand from another instruction
 * (using \ref madras_fctcall_addparam_frominsn), an integer value (using \ref madras_fctcall_addparam_imm) or a global variable added by the
 * MADRAS patcher (using \ref madras_fctcall_addparam_fromglobvar). It is not possible to use an existing global variable as parameter.
 *
 * In the current version, all parameters are passed as 64 bits integers, so an inserted function can use either 64 bits integer or pointers as
 * parameters.
 *
 * An inserted function call can be set to return a value, using \ref madras_fctcall_addreturnval. The return value must be a global variable added
 * by the MADRAS patcher. Like the parameters, the return value is a 64 bits integer, so it can be either an integer or a pointer.
 *
 * \subsubsection madrasdoc_insasminsns Inserting assembly instructions
 *
 * It is possible to add assembly instructions either in string format using \ref madras_insnlist_add or as a queue of \ref insn_t structures
 * using \ref madras_add_insns. The instructions will be added at the given address without any check nor wrapping instructions.
 *
 * Instructions present in inserted lists can reference a global variable added by the MADRAS patcher. An instruction referencing such a variable must
 * use a memory operand using the instruction pointer as base and a null displacement (\c 0(%RIP)). An array of pointers to the
 * \c globvar_t structures describing the references global variables must be passed as parameter to the function, with the pointers appearing
 * in the same order in the array as they appear in the instruction list (it is possible for a pointer to appear more than once if the corresponding
 * global variable is to be referenced multiple times).
 *
 * Instructions added using \ref madras_insnlist_add must be passed as strings, all written in upper case, and separated by "\n" characters.
 * Such lists can use labels (identified as followed by a colon character ":" and beginning a line) to reference branch destinations. It is
 * not possible to reference a label in the patched file in an inserted list.
 *
 * \subsubsection madrasdoc_insertbranch Inserting a branch instruction
 *
 * It is possible to insert an unconditional branch instruction using \ref madras_branch_insert. The branches added using this function can point either to an
 * existing instruction in the file (referenced by its address) or another modification request (only insertions modification requests are currently supported).
 * In the latter case, the branch will point to the first instruction inserted by the modification.
 *
 * It is also possible to choose whether the branch must be updated if a code insertion is performed before its destination. The standard behaviour would be to update
 * the branch to point to the beginning of the inserted code, but an option allows to override this behaviour to ensure the branch always points to the same instruction.
 *
 * \subsubsection madrasdoc_modifinsn Modifying an instruction
 *
 * It is possible to modify an instruction at a given address using \ref madras_modify_insn. This function allows to change the opcode and/or some or all
 * operands of the instruction; it is also possible to remove or add operands. Opcodes and operands must be provided as strings identical to their
 * assembly representation, written in capital case.
 *
 * A flag allows to choose the behaviour of the patcher when the modified instruction has a smaller coding than the original. In such a case, the
 * MADRAS patcher can pad the remaining space with \c nop instructions, which allows to avoid moving the basic block containing the modified instruction
 * as is the standard behaviour.
 *
 * There is no test on the validity of the requested modifications when performing the request. If the modified instruction is invalid, an assembly
 * error will be returned when committing the changes.
 *
 * \subsubsection madrasdoc_delinsns Deleting instructions
 *
 * It is possible to delete one or more instructions in the file using \ref madras_delete_insns. The instructions will be removed from the patched file.
 * All direct branch targets pointing to a deleted instruction will be updated to point to the first non deleted next instruction.
 *
 * The function \ref madras_replace_insns allows to delete one or more instructions and replace them with \c nop instructions to preserve the size
 * of the program, thus eliminating the need to move a basic block. Direct branches instructions pointing to any replaced instruction are updated
 * to point to the first instruction of the replacement block instead.
 *
 * \subsubsection madrasdoc_linkmodifs Linking modification requests
 *
 * It is possible to link modification requests from one to another. This is only supported for modifications representing a insertion request (for code,
 * function call, branches...). Linking a modification M' to modification M will ensure that the code of M' is executed after the one of M.
 * - If the linked modification M' has an non null address, an unconditional branch will be added after the last instruction inserted by M, branching to
 * the first instruction inserted by M'.
 * - If the linked modification M' has a null address, the code that it should insert will be directly appended to the code inserted by M.
 *
 * \subsubsection madrasdoc_conds Adding conditions on modification requests
 *
 * It is possible to add conditions for the execution of the code generated by the modification request when running the patched file. This is currently
 * supported only for modifications representing a insertion (of code, function call, branch...).
 *
 * A condition object must first be created using \ref madras_cond_new. A condition can be formed with either:
 * - A numerical value, an assembly operand (in a \ref oprnd_t structure) and a comparison operator (<, =, <=...)
 * - Two other conditions and a logical operator (AND or OR).
 *
 * It is thus possible to build a complex conditions using multiple comparison of operands and values. The current version does not support a comparison
 * between two random assembly operands.
 *
 * A condition object can be attached to an existing modification using \ref madras_modif_addcond. If another condition was already attached to this modification,
 * the final condition attached to the modification will be formed by both conditions and the specified logical operand (AND by default).
 *
 * It is also possible to add a condition to a modification from its string representation, using \ref madras_modif_setcond_fromstr. The string representation
 * of a condition must obey a syntax close to the one used in C:
 * - All conditions are enclosed by brackets (\"(\" and \")\")
 * - A condition is either formed by two conditions separated by a logical operator (\"&&\" or \"||\"), or an assembly operand and a value separated by
 * a comparison operator (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)
 * - Assembly operands used in conditions must be enclosed by quotes (\")
 *
 * A modification to which a condition was added can also get an else statement, using \ref madras_modif_addelse.
 * An else statement is a modification (only insertions are supported) set at a null address (an error will be raised if it is not).
 * The code inserted by this modification will be executed if the condition is not met.
 *
 * \subsection madrasdoc_patchopt Patcher options
 *
 * The \ref madras_modifs_addopt function allows to tweak the behaviour of the patcher for a whole patching session. The \ref madras_modif_addopt offers
 * the same functionality, but limited to a single modification request.
 *
 * \subsubsection madrasdoc_patchopt_insmode Options altering code displacement
 *
 * It is possible to alter how the MADRAS patcher handles code displacement when performing modifications that implies a change of size.
 *
 * By default, the MADRAS patcher will not perform an insertion if there is not enough space in the code (see documentation of \e libmpatch for more detailed
 * information). It is possible to set an option (\ref PATCHOPT_FORCEINS) forcing it to perform all requested insertions even when there is
 * not enough space in the code. For specific cases this can cause insertions to actually succeed because adjacent blocks are also moved, thus leaving
 * enough space for the insertions.
 *
 * By default, the MADRAS patcher moves basic blocks when inserting code. This may lead to insertion failing when a basic block is too small for the insertion.
 * An option (\ref PATCHOPT_MOVEFCTS) allows the MADRAS patcher to attempt moving whole functions when such a case is encountered. This allows most patching
 * operations to succeed, but can lead to errors in the patched file if a function has been incorrectly detected or if there are indirect branches
 * from other functions pointing to the middle of the moved function (this is often the case in OpenMP code).
 *
 * Conversely, the \ref PATCHOPT_MOV1INSN allows the MADRAS patcher to move only one instruction. This option must be used with caution as it disables
 * other checks and the use of trampolines. It should be reserved for cases where it can be sure that the address at a given modification is
 * large enough to insert a branch (for x86-64 this is 5 bytes).
 *
 * Those options may allow more patching operations to succeed, by increasing the risk of causing the patched executable to crash.
 * Using those options is unadvised on generic cases. The behaviour of the MADRAS patcher is also not defined if those options are used on some
 * but not all of the modification requests in a same basic block.
 *
 * \subsubsection madrasdoc_patchopt_branchupd Options altering branch updates
 *
 * It is possible to alter how the MADRAS patcher handles the updates of branches to instruction before which some code is added.
 *
 * The default behaviour of the patcher is to update all branches to an instruction to point to the first instruction of code inserted before it.
 *
 * The \ref PATCHOPT_NO_UPD_EXTERNAL_BRANCHES and \ref PATCHOPT_NO_UPD_INTERNAL_BRANCHES allow to restrict those updates to the branch
 * instructions respectively belonging or not to the same function as the patched instruction.
 *
 * The \ref PATCHOPT_BRANCHINS_NO_UPD_DST concerns inserted branch instructions, and prevents the branch to be updated if instructions are inserted
 * before its destination.
 *
 * \subsection madrasdoc_changepadding Changing the padding instruction
 *
 * By default, the instruction used to pad sections of code moved because of code displacement when performing modifications is the shortest \c nop
 * instruction available for the given architecture. It is possible to impose another instruction either for a given modification or for the whole
 * patching session, using respectively \ref madras_modifs_setpaddinginsn and \ref madras_modif_setpaddinginsn. The given instruction must have the same
 * length as \c nop, or an error will be raised.
 *
 * \subsection madrasdoc_commit Committing changes
 *
 * The final step in all patching sessions must be committing the changes using the \ref madras_modifs_commit function. It will perform all staged modifications and
 * generate a patched file with the requested name (it is advised not to use the same name as the original).
 *
 * The operations will be performed in the following order:
 * - Applying requests for renaming of dynamic libraries
 * - Applying requests for addition of dynamic libraries (and static libraries, but this is currently not implemented)
 * - Applying requests for addition of global variables
 * - Applying all requests for code modification (insertions, deletions and modifications) in the order of their addresses
 * - Saving the patched file under the given name
 * - Freeing the list of pending requests
 *
 * At this point the generated patched file contains all requested changes (except for those that caused an error during patching). It is not advised to keep using the MADRAS
 * \ref elfdis_t structure or the \c asmfile_t structure it contains for other operations.
 *
 * \section madrasdoc_logging Logging
 *
 * The \e libmadras API allows to record all requests performed on a disassembled file and write them to a log file. By default, this feature is turned off and can be
 * activated using the \ref madras_traceon function. It is also possible to choose the name of the log file (by default \c madras_trace.log).
 *
 * All invoked API functions will be recorded in the log, along with their parameters. The script \c madras_log2C.sh allows to turn such a file into a C source file, allowing
 * to compile it and rerun the requests.
