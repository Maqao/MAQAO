 * \page disass_fsmdesc Finite state machine
 *
 * \brief This page describes the implementation of the LR(0) parser used by the 
 * \e libmdisass disassembler as a finite state machine automaton.
 *
 * We will not describe here the general principles behind LR-parsing and finite state machines.
 *
 * \section fsmmain Main principles
 *
 * The main components the automaton uses are the following:
 * - <b>Input stream</b>: The stream of data to parse, and the pointer to the character being currently read
 * - <b>Transition end pointer</b>: Pointer in the input stream to the byte immediately after the already processed bytes
 * - <b>States</b>: Array of states for the finite state machine being currently used to parse the input stream.
 * - <b>Buffer</b>: Stack containing the results of the reductions from the current parsing operation and the associated states
 * - <b>Tokens</b>: Array containing the values of the tokens decoded during the current parsing operation.
 * - <b>Variables</b>: Array containing the results of the executions of the semantic actions of reduced 
 *                     variables during the current parsing operation
 *
 * All informations needed by the automaton are stored in a \ref fsmcontext_t structure.
 *
 * \subsection fsmstates Automaton states
 * The states of an automaton are stored into \ref fsmstate_t structure. There are two types of states:
 * - <b>Shift states</b> are states leading to other states. They are associated to a list of transitions values, accessed
 * through the array of the first sub values of the transitions.
 * - <b>Reduction states</b> are "leaf" states corresponding to the reduction of a symbol. 
 *   They are associated to a semantic action.
 *
 * Some of the reduction states are also associated to a final action, that will have to be executed 
 * once a word is parsed. For the disassembler, these final actions are used to fill the extensions.
 *
 * \subsection fsmtrans Automaton transitions
 *
 * The transitions in a state are separated between transitions on a reduced grammar symbol and on binary values.
 *
 * Transitions on a reduced grammar symbol are stored as a table indexed on the identifier of the symbols, containing the
 * identifier of the next state associated to this transition value. If a state does not contain a transition over a symbol,
 * the corresponding cell in the table contains a special identifier indicating a match failure.
 *
 * Transitions on values are broken down into a series of sub values 1 byte long or smaller. Each sub value is accompanied by a mask specifying
 * which bits of the sub value are useful (the corresponding bit in the mask is set to 1 if the bit is useful, 0 otherwise).
 * Each sub value contains either a table containing the following sub values in the transition or the identifier of the next state if the
 * sub value was the last in the transition. A cell in a table of sub values may contain a list of sub values with different masks,
 * ordered by priority of the corresponding transitions.
 *
 * \section fsminit Initialisation
 * \subsection fsminitfsm Initialising FSM context
 * During initialisation of the FSM, a new \ref fsmcontext_t structure is created using \ref fsm_init.
 * This creation needs a pointer to the function loading the details of the FSM to use. Such a function must 
 * have the following characteristics:
 * - \b Input: A pointer to an already allocated \ref fsmcontext_t structure
 * - \b Actions: Initialises the following members of the structure:
 *  - Number of symbols (token and variables) used in the automaton.
 *  - Array of states used by the automaton. This array must be ordered so that the first state of the automaton is the first in the array.
 *  - Array of pointers to the functions to execute at the end of a successful parsing.
 *  - Maximum size in bits of an instruction.
 *  - Maximum size in bits of a transition.
 *
 * Those parameters will remain loaded until the FSM is terminated and its context is freed. In the context of the disassembler,
 * they are equivalent to loading the specifics for the parsing of a given architecture in the FSM.
 *
 * Optionally, an error handler can be set using \ref fsm_seterrorhandler. This allows to have a specific 
 * function being executed on the current output when a parsing error occurs.
 *
 * \subsection fsminitparser Initialising parsing run
 *
 * A parsing run is the parsing of a given input stream. The stream to parse is initialised using 
 * \ref fsm_setstream. This allows to set a string of bytes, the offset in the string at which the parsing 
 * must begin and the number of bytes to parse in the string.
 *
 * The \ref fsm_parseinit function must next be invoked to signal the parser that a new run will begin.
 *
 * This step can be repeated multiple times for a given FSM context if multiple runs on different streams are 
 * needed for a given FSM.
 *
 * \section fsmparse Parsing a stream
 *
 * During the parsing of a stream, the automaton will read the stream attempting to parse a word. Once 
 * the parsing is complete, either because a word has been parsed or a parsing error occurred, the automaton 
 * will be reset and the next word will be read. If the length of stream to parse is reached, the parsing 
 * will stop.
 *
 * \subsection fsmmatchtrans Matching with transitions
 *
 * Matching an input value against a group of transitions on values is performed through the following algorithm:
 * -# Initialising the array of sub values with the array of the first sub values in the transition
 * -# While the next state is not found
 *   - If the table is marked as always OK, check if the length remaining in the input stream is bigger than the
 *   length of the sub values in the table and raise a parser error if it is not
 *   - If the table is marked as containing a single sub value, retrieve a value with the length of the sub values from the input stream
 *   and check it against the sub value in the table. The transition end pointer is then moved by the length of the sub value.
 *   - If the table is marked as containing multiple values, retrieve a value with the length of the sub values from the input stream
 *   and looks up the cell whose index is this value. The transition end pointer is then moved by the length of the sub value.
 *     - If the cell does not contain a sub value, raise a parser error
 *     - If the cell contains a list of sub values and masks, check them against the input value
 *   - If no parser error was raised, a sub value matching the input was found.
 *     - If it contains a state identifier, the transition is complete.
 *     - Otherwise, it contains an array of the next sub values, which is loaded as the current array.
 *
 * \subsection fsmparseword Parsing a word
 *
 * The parsing of a word is performed according to the following steps:
 * -# Resetting the FSM. The buffer is emptied and the stack of states is reset to contain the first state of the automaton
 * -# Reading a number of bytes equal to the maximum length of an instruction (rounded up if necessary)
 * -# Processing the state on the top of the stack:
 *  - If it is a shift state, using its transitions to identify the next state
 *      - If a reduction just occurred, the transition will be attempted matching the identifier of the reduced symbol (see \ref fsmtrans).
 *      - If this match failed or if no reduction occurred, the transition will be attempted on the values from the input stream.
 *      The algorithm described in \ref fsmmatchtrans is executed, with the array of sub values initialised to the array of first sub values
 *      for the current state.
 *      - If a match is made, the state associated to the transition is added to the top of the stack of states. The pointer to the input stream
 *      is shift to the location of the transition end pointer.
 *      - If no match is made
 *         - If the state contains a default transition (transition over a null value), the corresponding state is added to the top
 *         of the stack of states.
 *         - Otherwise an error is raised. The error handler function is executed and the FSM is reset.
 *  - If it is a reduction state, it contains informations on the elements to retrieve and where to retrieve them
 *	 	-# The reductions will be performed by removing the bits from the entry buffer
 *	        - Bit fields are removed and discarded
 *	        - Tokens are reduced into \ref paramcoding_t structures containing their value and length, and
 *         stored in a cell of the array of reduced values from the \ref fsmcontext_t structure corresponding
 *         to their identifier from the grammar
 *          - Variables (symbols that have been reduced) are added to the buffer, but their value is not kept.
 *	 	-# The semantic action associated to the state is added to the list of semantic actions.
 *	 	-# If the state is associated to a final action, the final action to perform is set for the parsing 
 *       of this word. No word should be associated to more than one final action.
 *	 	-# The stack of states is updated to remove the states associated to all symbols removed from the buffer.
 *	    -# The reduced variable is returned, to be used as input for a possible match for the next shift state
 *	- If the symbol \c Axiom has been reduced, the processing of the states stops.
 * -# The list of semantic actions is executed, in the order of their occurrences
 * -# The pointer to the result of the parsing is added to the first cell of the array of reduced symbols
 * -# If there is a final action, it is executed
 * -# The array of reduced symbols and the list of semantic actions are reset
