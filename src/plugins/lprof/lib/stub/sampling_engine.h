 * Samples an application with perf_events
 * \param cmd command to run
 * \param output_path path to the lprof output/experiment directory
 * \param sampling_period sampling period (number of events per sample)
 * \param hwc_list List of hardware events name+period to sample. Ex: "CPU_CLK_THREAD_UNHALTED:REF_XCLK@500003,MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED:L1_HIT@500003
 * \param user_guided -1 = user control disabled, 0 = CTRL+Z pauses/resumes sampling and n > 0 = delays sampling from n seconds
 * \param backtrace_mode Backtraces/callchains mode: OFF, CALL, STACK and BRANCH
 * \param cpu_list "0,1,2,3" to limit profiling to CPU0-3
 * \param mpi_target path to application executable if masked to MAQAO by MPI command (inherit-mode only)
 * \param nb_sampler_threads number of threads to process samples in ring buffers
 * \param inherit boolean true if inherit mode requested, ptrace-mode otherwise
 * \param sync boolean true if syncronous tracer requested, asyncronous otherwise (ptrace-mode only)
 * \param finalize_signal Signal used by some parallel launchers to notify ranks finalization
 * \param verbose boolean true if less critical warnings has to be displayed. Forwarded from args.verbose
 * \param max_buf_MB maximum memory buffer size in MB
 * \param files_buf_MB temporary files buffer size in MB
 * \param max_files_MB maximum total temporary files size in MB
